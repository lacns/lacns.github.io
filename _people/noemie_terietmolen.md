bio: I am the new research coordinator working with Andrea Martin in the Language and Computation in Neural Systems (LaCNS) group. I am most interested in the neural mechanism underlying hierarchical and rhythmic cognition and the roles rhythmic/metrical structures play in the perception and processing of speech. I have a background in Cognitive Sciences from the University of Amsterdam and a Ph.D. (entitled <i>Neural signature of metrical stress processing in French</i>) in Linguistics at the University of Toulouse under the supervision of Corine Astésano and Simon Thorpe. After the Ph.D., I joined the Institut de Neuroscience des Systèmes (INS) in Marseille, where, with Daniele Schön and Benjamin Morillon, we explored the neural mechanisms underlying speech and music processing with intracranial (sEEG) data, and, where, with Kristof Strijkers (Laboratoire Parole Langage; LPL) and Benjamin Morillon, I worked on a project that set out to examine the different roles the motor system plays in sensorimotor integration for speech comprehension (funding ILCB).

## Overview

Short description in *your* words:

- Works on ...
- Known for ...
- Main connection to my work: ...

## Current focus (lab-specific)

- Current main project(s): [[comp_syntax_manifolds]], [[sprite_trf_composition]]
- Key questions they care about:
  - 
  - 

## Key contributions

- To [[project:comp_syntax_manifolds]]:
  - e.g. CEBRA manifold analysis, linking phrase boundaries to trajectory bends.
- To [[project:sprite_trf_composition]]:
  - e.g. TRF pipeline for word-level features (surprisal, entropy, KL, etc.).

## Methods & skills

- Analysis: TRFs, encoding models, mixed-effects (R: lmerTest, Python: statsmodels)
- Data: MEG (CTF275), behavior, corpus linguistics
- Tools: Python, R, Neovim, HPC (SLURM)

## Conceptual connections

- Strongly connected to:
  - [[neural_manifolds]]
  - [[semantic_composition]]
  - [[language_as_structured_codex]]
- Compare/contrast with:
  - [[person:another_lab_member]] on approach to manifolds / oscillations.

## Open questions / ideas related to this person

- How does their approach to [[neural_manifolds]] differ from others in the lab?
- What would be a natural collaboration with them?
- Any “signature” plots/figures I associate with them?

## Log

- YYYY-MM-DD – Met to discuss X, noted idea about Y → linked to [[concept:some_idea]].
- YYYY-MM-DD – Their result in [[project:...]] changed how I think about [[hierarchical_oscillations]].
