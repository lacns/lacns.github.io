bio: I am a visiting PhD student from the University of Zagreb, Croatia. My research focuses on neural tracking of sub-lexical representations while listening to naturalistic language stimuli. My background is in computer science and computational linguistics. In the experiment for my doctoral thesis, I will use scalp EEG and use linear modeling of electrophysiological data to try to determine how and under which conditions the brain tracks sub-lexical linguistic units on different scales of granularity.
