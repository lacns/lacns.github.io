bio: I am a visiting PhD student based at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. My research interest is in the neural processing of taboo and emotionality in language, as well as how social and individual factors contribute to the way taboo language is perceived. In my Masters', I normed the most frequent taboo words in Brazilian Portuguese and conducted an EEG experiment to investigate the time-course of taboo processing, relating the brain activity to psychosocial characteristics such as religiosity and family environment in upbringing. In the LaCNS, I will use naturalistic stimuli in an MEG experiment to uncover the neural responses to emotional and taboo speech in Brazilian Portuguese.
