bio: I am a PhD student in the Language and Computation in Neural Systems (LaCNS), supervised by Andrea Martin. I hold a Master's degree in Linguistics from Boğaziçi University, where my research compared a supervised morphological rule learner against child acquisition patterns of the Turkish Aorist. I am particularly interested in combining computational modeling with empirical data to understand how linguistic structures are learned, represented, and processed across different systems. My primary research interests include theoretical linguistics, language acquisition, neurolinguistics, computational linguistics, and deep learning.
