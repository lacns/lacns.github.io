bio: I am a second year master's student in Linguistics with interest in theoretical morphology/syntax and morphological processing from a cross-linguistic perspective. I completed my bachelor's in Linguistics at Hacettepe University, where I studied semantics of control verbs in Turkish. In my master's thesis, I investigate whether the brain is sensitive to incremental and categorical aspects of morphological structure during speech comprehension. Using MEG data and Temporal Response Function modeling, I aim to characterize how morphological information is encoded over time in the brain.
