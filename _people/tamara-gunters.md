bio: I am a second year student in the Language and Communication track of the Cognitive Neuroscience master. Before coming to Nijmegen, I did my bachelor's degree in Liberal Arts and Sciences at University College Utrecht where I focused on linguistics, philosophy, and cognitive neuroscience. For my internship in the LaCNS group at the MPI for Psycholinguistics, I am using MEG data to look at the neural encoding of sped-up speech in a listener's brain. I will try to see whether the brain tracks linguistic units according to fixed timescales or based on the rate at which linguistic information occurs.
